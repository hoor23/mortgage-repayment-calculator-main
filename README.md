## Overview

### The challenge

The goal of this project was to create a responsive landing page that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes while maintaining a clean and modern design. The page is meant to showcase various frontend techniques, including a fully responsive layout, animations, and interactive elements.

The core challenge was to:

- Implement a mobile-first design that transitions smoothly to larger screens.
- Create an engaging and interactive layout using semantic HTML and modern CSS.
- Handle dynamic content with JavaScript for interactive elements (e.g., buttons, hover states).

## My process

### Built with

- **HTML5** for semantic structure and content organization
- **CSS3** for styling, including Flexbox for layout and custom properties for theming
- **JavaScript** for interactive elements and dynamic content loading
- **Responsive Design** using a mobile-first approach, ensuring compatibility across various devices

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of:

- **CSS Grid and Flexbox** for layout design. I was able to organize complex page elements while maintaining responsiveness.
- **Media Queries** to adapt styles for different screen sizes. This was crucial in making sure the landing page looked good on both small and large devices.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic interactions, such as button click events and changing content without page reloads.

### Continued development

For future improvements, I plan to:

- **Improve accessibility** by ensuring all elements are keyboard navigable and by implementing ARIA roles for screen readers.
- Explore more advanced **JavaScript** to handle form submissions and data storage in local storage.
- **Optimize performance**, including minifying CSS/JS and optimizing images for faster loading times.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Flexbox Guide - This article helped me solidify my understanding of Flexbox, which I used heavily in the layout.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - The MDN documentation was an invaluable resource, particularly when dealing with JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Plus+Jakarta+Sans) - I used Google Fonts to find clean, modern typography that fits well with the page design.
